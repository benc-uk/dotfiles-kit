# Dotfiles Kit

This is a starting point for creating your own dotfiles repo, it uses [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and the [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme.

It is based heavily on my own dotfiles repo with a lot of the personalization & aliases etc removed.

## File Index

- `.aliases.rc` â€“ All aliases go here (used with Bash and Zsh)
- `.banner.rc` â€“ Logon banner message (used with Bash and Zsh)
- `.bashprompt.rc` â€“ Bash prompt, like a poor mans p10k for Bash, disable with BASIC_PROMPT=1
- `.bashrc` â€“ Bash setup/startup script
- `.env.rc` â€“ Environmental vars and PATH settings, symlinked to `~/.bashenv` & `~/.zshenv`
- `.gitconfig` â€“ Git config
- `.p10k.zsh` â€“ Customized Powerlevel10k prompt settings
- `.profile` â€“ Untouched but synced just in case
- `.zshrc` â€“ Zsh setup/startup script, enables Oh My Zsh and Powerlevel10k
- `backup.sh` â€“ Git add, commit and push to GitHub
- `install-zsh.sh` â€“ Installs Zsh
- `install.sh` â€“ Main install script
- `update.sh` â€“ Pulls version from GitHub and overwrites local changes
